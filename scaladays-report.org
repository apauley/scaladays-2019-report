... which I Attended

** [[https://scaladays.org/schedule/a-tour-of-scala-3][A Tour of Scala 3]] (Keynote)

Martin Odersky ([[https://www.twitter.com/odersky][@odersky]])

=Summary:=
Some cool new features that makes Scala development easier and simpler for beginners,
as well as many features that will help you when writing functional programs.

** [[https://scaladays.org/schedule/a-story-of-unification-from-apache-spark-to-mlflow][A story of unification: from Apache Spark to MLflow]] (Sponsored Keynote)

Reynold Xin ([[https://www.twitter.com/rxin][@rxin]])

=Summary:= Data pipelines using Scala is cool. Also, you should use our commercial products.

** [[https://scaladays.org/schedule/techniques-for-teaching-scala][Techniques for Teaching Scala]]

Noel Welsh ([[https://www.twitter.com/noelwelsh][@noelwelsh]])

=Summary:= We should focus on developing our teaching skills. Here are some useful ways to do this in Scala.

** [[https://scaladays.org/schedule/akka-streams-to-the-extreme][Akka Streams to the Extreme]]

Heiko Seeberger ([[https://www.twitter.com/hseeberger][@hseeberger]])

=Summary:= Akka Actors have many anti-patterns. Here is an example where doing distributed computation with Akka Streams can be better.

** [[https://scaladays.org/schedule/massively-parallel-distributed-scala-compilation----and-you][Massively Parallel Distributed Scala Compilation... And You!]]

Stu Hood ([[https://www.twitter.com/stuhood][@stuhood]])

=Summary:= Twitter is doing some amazing things to speed up compilation on a code base with millions of lines of Scala code.

** [[https://scaladays.org/schedule/making-our-future-better][Making Our Future Better]]

Viktor Klang ([[https://www.twitter.com/viktorklang][@viktorklang]])

=Summary:=
In future Future's will still immediately start running when created. I am Viktor, and I declare that this is a feature, not a bug.
Regardless, there are a few things that can be done to make an eager Future faster and better. We've done those things.

** [[https://scaladays.org/schedule/the-shapeless-of-type-class-derivation-in-scala-3][The Shape(less) of Type Class Derivation in Scala 3]]

Miles Sabin ([[https://www.twitter.com/milessabin][@milessabin]])

=Summary:=
I modified the compiler in a few trivial ways so you can see the code that get generated at compile time when I do these simple but totally incomprehensible things.
The reason why you would want to do these uncomprehensible things is unclear. Maybe it only applies to people wanting to write the Shapeless library.
